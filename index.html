      <h1>Is there a better way to pay artists for music streaming?</h1>

      It's no secret that artists earn paltry payouts from streaming platforms. With ticket sales as their primary source of income, musicians were hit particularly hard when live performances shut down in 2020. But leveling the playing field in music streaming isn't as simple as increasing platforms' per-stream payout. Most streaming companies operate on a <a href="https://qz.com/1660465/the-way-spotify-and-apple-music-pays-artists-isnt-fair/">"pro-rata"</a> model, meaning all streaming revenue from the platform is combined into a pot that is then divided among rights holders based on their share of streams on that platform in a given year. For instance, if Lil Nas X accounts for 5% of all streams on Spotify in 2021, he'll receive 5% of the platform's streaming revenue from all users. So even if you never listen to Lil Nas X, part of your $10-a-month Spotify subscription (or the ad revenue from free users) would go to his payout from the platform. Many in the industry have advocated for a switch to a user-centric payment model, where artists would be paid based on who actually listens to their music. In this model, the artists whose music you listen to would receive the revenue from those streams, not from a percentage of all revenue as in the pro-rata model. But <a href="http://www.muusikkojenliitto.fi/usercentric/">preliminary studies</a> have shown <a href="https://cnm.fr/le-cnm-evalue-limpact-dun-changement-eventuel-de-mode-de-remuneration-par-les-plateformes-de-streaming/">mixed results</a> for this model increasing payouts for artists.

      Streaming companies are notoriously secretive about their per-stream rates, and the rates themselves are difficult to calculate because of the nature of the pro-rata model. The Wall Street Journal <a href=https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-music-reveals-how-much-it-pays-when-you-stream-a-song-11618579800>reported earlier this year</a> that Apple Music pays rights holders $0.01 per stream, according to a letter the company sent to artists, publishers and record labels. However, that rate could still fluctuate based on how Apple arrived at that figure. For the sake of consistency, I've chosen to use this data from <a href="https://thetrichordist.com/2020/03/05/2019-2020-streaming-price-bible-youtube-is-still-the-1-problem-to-solve/">The Trichordist,</a> which published the 2019 streaming payouts from an anonymous mid-sized indie label with an album catalog of over 350 and annual streams of over 1.5 billion. While a better streaming payout model remains to be seen, there's one clear solution to making sure artists get paid: buy their music.
